            <h1>Our Why's</h1>
            <i>(Beware of Essays)</i>
            <p>
                Before we decided to get married in 2021, we told each other it was imperative to know why. We had already known we'd marry eventually, but we didn't know when and never solidified why. We had to establish these reasons in order to give ourselves a strong base to fall back on when the trials of life come to test our love and commitment. We came up with a set of fundamental reasons for us as a team as well as our own individual reasons for getting married. We believe in our why's wholeheartedly. Nevertheless, we know we are flawed and lack experience, so we must constantly evaluate and amend our reasons as time matures our marriage and love. There will be a quiz on these reasons at the reception. Hopefully you'll study, but it will be open note.
            </p>
            <div class="h-line"></div>  <!------------------------------->
            <h2>Together</h2>
            <p>
                Our joint reasons are separated into four main sections: why <b><i>marry</i></b>, why <b><i>each other</i></b>, why <b><i>marry</i></b> each other, and why marry <b><i>now</i></b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Why marry" deals with our belief in marriage. We believe in marriage because the binding covenant makes a team stronger together than on their own and develops character. Two are stronger than one. When one is shaken, the other can lend a hand. When both are shaken, they can crawl out of the trenches together. The team can also make more of an impact and take on greater challenges. In essence, a married couple can take bigger hits and give more. Additionally, marriage enhances a person's qualities. It will bring out the best, and it will also bring out the worst. For those whose seek to grow, marriage will elicit the vices of one's heart and give them a chance to address the cracks in their character, such as selfishness, insensitivity, apathy, not being punctual, and much more. Therefore, we believe in marriage because we can serve more together than apart and we can help each other grow more like Jesus each day. 
            </p>
            <p>
                "Why each other" covers why we are set apart for each other and no one else. Despite the notion that opposites attract, marriage is more enjoyable when hearts and minds are compatible. Though there is a time and place for everything, especially friction and discomfort, we are to "live happily with the [one] you love through all the meaningless days of life..." (Ecclesiastes 9:9). In order to set ourselves up for an awesome marriage, we vetted each other in the beginning to see if the other met several criteria that leads to a healthy marriage. The three areas we valued most for compatibility were having a servant's mentality, being best friends, and long term direction. One of the devotions we did when we first started dating emphasized that happy couples fully embrace the mindset that they owe each other everything and expect nothing in return. This is the spirit of husband submitting to wife and wife submitting to husband. Additionally, we envision the ideal marriage as a covenant between two best friends and God. If you are going to spend the rest of your life with someone, wouldn't you want this person to exemplify what you see in a good friend? Guys bond best by doing something with someone and girls typically bond through sincere conversation. Being best friends includes doing and talking about anything and everything. This will strengthen our bond as we cleave to each other. Lastly, we chose each other because we are heading in the same direction. We are both running towards God with all we have, and we both are pressing towards a life of service. We like to view our paths as two phototropic vines. When we get married, our paths intertwine as we grow towards the light. The light might guide people different ways, and tension builds as the two vines try to grow in different directions. Since we are both called to live this life of service and missions, our dreams won't take us far from each other. Therefore, we choose each other for the state, interaction, and the direction of our hearts.

            <p>
                "Why marry each other" addresses the question of why can't we just be really good friends or be with each other doing everything a married couple does just without the married part. This can also be viewed as the rebuttal and refutation for the first two reasons. First, we need to define what marriage is. As mentioned in the first reason, marriage is a binding covenant. Marriage is the joining of two souls, committing to be one for the rest of their days. We want to be unified, experiencing life together as one heart and one soul. By just being really good friends, we wouldn't get to experience everything together and the things would experience wouldn't have the same depth. It would be like watching a nature documentary instead of hiking a mountain in person. Additionally, marriage is like a moral jig. A jig guides you so you don't mess up. In this case, messing up would be separating what God has joined together. Marriage is a binding covenant. Just saying you'll be there for someone without getting married makes it too easy to quit on each other. Also, a couple is "taking their word for it" when they exchange vows. Vows express loyalty and commitment. We are going to express that commitment for all to hear to keep us accountable and bring glory to God.

            <p>
                "Why marry now" is our last reason, and it explains the timing of our marriage. We knew we were going to marry at some point in our lives, but we didn't know when. It isn't wise to rush marriage for physical reasons, which is why physical intimacy is not part of our reasoning and never has. We are getting married going into our junior year of college because it is a unique time to be married, we already needed to be married before Luke commissioned upon graduation so Ede could receive the Post-911 GI Bill, and the financial aid would reduce the cost of school. Once we graduate college, we will never have the chance to be married college students again. Marriage is an intimate relationship. Intimacy is defined as sharing experiences with each other. What a fruitful experience it will be to suffer through endless waves of schooling together as husband and wife! The bond and growth as a result of these trials will be remarkable. College is commonly known to be the place where you room and make memories with your best friends. We aren't pretending when we say we're best friends. As best friends, we also share each other's burdens. Ede is going to pursue a Doctorate of Optometry, and Luke would never let her take on student debt without him. A spouse or dependent are the only ones besides the veteran who can use the Post-911 GI Bill. Since the paperwork will be easier to complete before Luke commissions as a 2nd Lieutenant, it is favorable to get married before we graduate in December 2022. Getting married in the middle of the semester is complicated, so our options were summer 2021, winter 2021, or summer 2022. We would miss the opportunity for scholarships if we got married in the winter. Summer 2022 would only give us one semester of finanical aid. Therefore, to maximize our aid, getting married in the summer of 2021 was logical. We are getting married in April because Luke has to leave two weeks early for Officer Candidates School to quarantine. In summary, we are getting married now because we cherish doing life together and because it will alleviate the stress of tuition the most.

            <h2>Ede's Individual Response</h2>
            <p>
                In the past two years of dating, I have seen the profound wonders of God through Luke’s understanding and teaching of the gospel. I absolutely believe God has intertwined my heart with Luke’s for the purpose of making Him known through our marriage. On one of our first dates, we conversed about what God has called our hearts to do with our lives. Although we thought our paths looked different, it was the beginning of God moving through our relationship.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the events that took place in seeing God move through us was how He allowed us to bond. Early into our dating status Luke and I would pray about how we could make God known through acts of service. As we would choose one person a month to help and pray for, I learned more of what true love from Christ looked like. Everyone is so precious and deserves to know how loved they are by the Lord. From seeing true love, I received knowledge that my life is not my own and I have no authority in deciding what will happen. My life is to serve Christ and make disciples of all nations. Through this shift in my heart, I wanted to continue expressing what true love is to those around me with the partnership of Luke. Not only do I want to show the love of Christ by serving others, but intimately show the love of God to Luke. I desire to give all that I can in helping Luke become the man God handcrafted him to be.  “Let all that you do be done in love” (1 Corinthians 16:14). I want to marry Luke to show him G.L.U.E. To Give Love Unconditionally Everyday.
            </p>
            <p>
                To me loving Luke unconditionally everyday means loving Luke for Luke. Not for looks, occupation, personality, or the worldly items we commonly put on a pedestal. I desire to love Luke simply because he was made by the Father. I know I am not perfect and never will be, but I do know that God can help me love Luke for Luke when my human nature shows its faults. Even when Luke might be stinky from a casual twenty-mile run, I get the opportunity to unconditionally welcome Luke as Christ continues to.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I choose to marry Luke and stay with Luke until the end of my days. Marriage is a look into how Christ loved the Church. As Christ never leaves us and has a sustaining love, I vow to do the same for our marriage. When two become one flesh, the servanthood continues to remain faithful. Even in trials and tribulations, we lean back in the loving arms of the Father knowing that His plan is always for us and not against us. 
            </p>
            <div class="h-line"></div>  <!------------------------------->
            <h2>Luke's Individual Response</h2>
            <p>
                Whenever people commit to a long and tasking journey or mission, it is key they have something to keep them going when they enter the belly of the whale. The question, "Why are you marrying...", naturally leads people to weigh reasons that have the potential to change. It focuses on what brings them to the altar, not what will keep them together. Thus, I propose a better question, "Why will I stay married to Ede?" This places the angle of contemplation on the other side of our wedding day, when change has partnered with circumstance and logic comes to challenge us. Therefore, these reasons must be separated from circumstance or be an anchor in the future. I am going to marry and stay married to Ede because I want to offer her a love that helps her grow, to grow old with my best friend, and to love Ede for Ede -- not for what she does or even who she is.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am meeting Ede at the altar and will remain by her side long after because I want to help her progress and be more. I want the privilege of being the one who helps her accomplish her dreams and serves alongside her. In this way, my love and reason for marrying and staying with Ede depends on something within me in my heart, not on a desirable quality she posses, although she does have many of those. When I come across anger, frustration, or any other difficulties in life, this reason will draw me to overcome anything that stands between us. Thus, I enter this marriage because I want to help her be more kind, caring, serving, beautiful, graceful, and much more than if she were without me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have never desired many friends. However, I crave to have that one friend with whom I could do and share anything and everything. Should I ever reach old age, I want someone who has been through a lot with me. I want someone who knows me better than I know myself at times. I want to be with my best friend. The more I invest in the relationship God gave me and Ede, the more we will enjoy each other, especially when we're old. Moreover, it is better to enjoy what you have than desiring what you don't have. This reason will drive me to always keep our love fresh and to never leave. I am marrying Ede and will stay with her because I know you reap what you sow. If I press on in the hardships, we will reap a relationship more savoring than Whataburger after being out of state.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will be married to Ede because I love and support <i>Ede</i>, not what she does for me or who she is. Most know it is bad to love someone just for what they do but uncommon to denounce only loving someone for who they are. People can change. Many men are thankful their wives didn't love them for who they were when they went through their mid-life crisis. Unconditional love is the standard I set for myself. It is possible to love someone just because you want to love them. A clear concern about my first two reasons is they start with a desire. My wants will change as I grow, and no one knows what they will be. I am sure several would tell me someday I will not want to help Ede nor be friendly, but that's why this last reason is so important. The theology of Christianity is based on a love that didn't need a reason to love. Thanks to my faith in Jesus and Him showing me how to love, I don't need a reason to love Ede, which is why we'll be married until we're called home.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will marry Ede and stay married to her because I want to love her in a way that nourishes and enriches, to have a friend in the end, and because I love her just to love her. As a result, I will "live happily with the woman [I] love through all the meaningless days of life."
